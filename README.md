# convrt.io

Convrt.io is an alternative chatting interface for the messenger provided by LinkedIn. Along with a well arranged design, convrt.io offers the possibility to sort your different contacts via a labeling functionality. The long-term goal is to implement an intelligent assistant, which helps the user organizing his messaging as well as his appointment scheduling.

## Running the project

Simply run:

`chmod +x bash convrt.sh`

and afterwards:

`bash convrt.sh`

After running through the setup, which can take up to a few minutes, CONVRT should be available at localhost:3000. Enter your LinkedIn Credentials and wait for convrt
to transfer your conversations.
